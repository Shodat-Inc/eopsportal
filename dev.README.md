1. Since i was working on crud application, there was an API THAT i missed out i.e forgot password api,so i will work on that today.How iam going to implement this ,on clicking on Forgot password,user will enter the email and we will verify the email  by sending a mail on that email and then it will give a link on mail at there user will reset his/her password.

2. Email verification - right now we are not verifying user email, so we can do this task using firebas email authentication 
else we can send the send link to email and on click on that link user will be marked as verified.
